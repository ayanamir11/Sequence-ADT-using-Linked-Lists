# Sequence ADT using Linked Lists
This project re-implements the Sequence data structure using a custom LinkedList and ListNode in Java.
It focuses on information hiding, modularity, and clean object-oriented design.

Features

- Custom implementation of a singly linked list (no Java built-ins)

- Full Sequence rewrite to use the new linked list structure

- Comprehensive JUnit tests for all core operations (insert, delete, traverse)

- Follows strong coding style, documentation, and abstraction principles
