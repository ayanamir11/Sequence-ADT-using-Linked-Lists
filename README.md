# CoinBank
A Java project that rebuilds the Sequence data structure using a custom LinkedList and ListNode instead of arrays. The project demonstrates information hiding, modularity, and object-oriented design by separating behavior from implementation. Includes JUnit tests for all core list operations such as insertion, deletion, and traversal.
